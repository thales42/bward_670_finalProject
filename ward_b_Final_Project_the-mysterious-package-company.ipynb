    "Crowdfunding on the internet started in 2000 and has since taken the form of many web-based companies from artistShare to Fundable, culminating into the JOBS Act passed by President Obama in 2012. Currently, Kickstarter is the most successful of these sites having funded over 3.6 billion dollars in projects to date. Much of what determines the overall success of these projects is their ability to attract supporters through social media. From the perspective of a small group of game designers, specializing in narrative-based puzzle games, I am proposing that we deconstruct the Kickstarter origins and continued usage of social media by the game company: **The Mysterious Package Company**. Funded back in 2012, The Mysterious Package Company continues to this day delivering narrative-based, puzzle experiences for those intrepid investigators seeking puzzles, codes, swag, and all manner of horror tinged storytelling in the form of subscription service packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Much of what makes this a unique opportunity is that the Company began with only three founders until they were futher funded by one of the founders of PopCap Games in 2014. Over the last six years, The Mysterious Package Company has had three Kickstarter campaigns, the last of which was funded at just over $600,000 dollars. Much of the Company’s ongoing success is based on their heavy reliance of their social media presence to sell engaging experiences.    \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The primary data sources will come from The Mysterious Package Company’s main social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data will be principally collected using Facebook's API, Twitter's API, and scraping Instagram. From there we will take an in-depth look at how The Mysterious Package Company handles its social media marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The types of data analysis used will focus mostly on social media as a marketing tool. As such, descriptive analytics (word frequency analysis and descriptive statistics) will be used to establish an overall impression of the tone created by The Mysterious Package Company. Content analytics (topic modeling, clustering, and sentiment analysis) will be used to establish what core narratives are sold by The Mysterious Package Company. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. The key benefit to be found in this proposal will be to provide insight for a small group of entrepreneurial game designers/developers who might be looking to build a similar or competing product. Much of the ongoing success of The Mysterious Package Company is clearly based on its ability to tell compelling narratives within its products and market these products repeatedly through the use of crowdfunding, social media, and finely nuanced storytelling.  \n"

gifted me this adorable bottle. She found it while shopping in a port bazaar, and the salesman gave it to her for next to nothing. My mother called it a fairy bottle, and knew it was mine the minute she saw it. \\nI've had it for several years, but something has changed. A few weeks ago, I swear a fly was trapped in the window. I could hear the buzzing and tapping on the glass; however, after checking every window in the house, there was no fly. This didn't strike me as odd at first, but after last night, I believe it's all connected. \\nA few days after the fly incident, I heard a faint croaking. It had rained earlier that day, so frogs were out in droves, and I thought one had slipped into the house. Again, I searched. Again, I found nothing. Every few days for the last several weeks, I would hear either a fly or a frog, but I could never find it. I've started dreaming about armies of frogs filling the city, crowding the roads, and even coming out of sink drains. Then, last night happened. \\nI had just started awake from another frog filled dream; I swear it was the frog release scene in E.T. In the darkness, I heard it, the buzzing of flies. I got out of bed and followed the sound. It was like a game of hot or cold: moving around the house to where the buzzing was loudest. I turned the corner from the hallway into the living room.  Sitting on top of the coffee table was the bottle, a sickly, green light glowing from within. Somehow, it had moved from the top of the stereo to its current position. I drew closer, and the glow became brighter. I moved to pull the lid from its resting place. Green light was everywhere. The next thing I remember, I was sitting on the couch, the bottle back in its place on the stereo. \\nI'm hoping someone at your company can tell me what I have in my home, and what could possibly have happened to me when I touched the bottle. If I can understand it, maybe I can live with it.

And whenever I did something wrong, I smelled smoke. My mom always seemed to know when I snuck out of bed and went downstairs to watch Headbanger's Ball at midnight. I knew the doll was somehow communicating with my mother to tell her what I was up to. As I grew into my teenage years, my mother had an uncanny ability to tell when I'd been smoking, or with a boy, and, one fine night when I was seventeen, she knew I'd been fall-down drunk behind Color Tile, covered in dry catfood and making out with Big Jay Austin. My mom said the fire alarm went off that night.\\n\\nMy mother gave me the doll as a wedding present. I keep it in my newborn daughter's room.

The next thing I remember, I was sitting on the couch, the bottle back in its place on the stereo. \\nI'm hoping someone at your company can tell me what I have in my home, and what could possibly have happened to me when I touched the bottle.

gifted me this adorable bottle. She found it while shopping in a port bazaar, and the salesman gave it to her for next to nothing. My mother called it a fairy bottle, and knew it was mine the minute she saw it. \\nI've had it for several years, but something has changed. A few weeks ago, I swear a fly was trapped in the window. I could hear the buzzing and tapping on the glass; however, after checking every window in the house, there was no fly. This didn't strike me as odd at first, but after last night, I believe it's all connected. \\nA few days after the fly incident, I heard a faint croaking. It had rained earlier that day, so frogs were out in droves, and I thought one had slipped into the house. Again, I searched. Again, I found nothing. Every few days for the last several weeks, I would hear either a fly or a frog, but I could never find it. I've started dreaming about armies of frogs filling the city, crowding the roads, and even coming out of sink drains. Then, last night happened. \\nI had just started awake from another frog filled dream; I swear it was the frog release scene in E.T. In the darkness, I heard it, the buzzing of flies. I got out of bed and followed the sound. It was like a game of hot or cold: moving around the house to where the buzzing was loudest. I turned the corner from the hallway into the living room.  Sitting on top of the coffee table was the bottle, a sickly, green light glowing from within. Somehow, it had moved from the top of the stereo to its current position. I drew closer, and the glow became brighter. I moved to pull the lid from its resting place. Green light was everywhere. The next thing I remember, I was sitting on the couch, the bottle back in its place on the stereo. \\nI'm hoping someone at your company can tell me what I have in my home, and what could possibly have happened to me when I touched the bottle. If I can understand it, maybe I can live with it.

The sad, tattered hobo of the depression era. Willie's dream was to be in the spotlight in a traveling circus, but unfortunately due to his slovenly appearance, he was forced to clean up after the other clowns instead of cultivating his own act. Willie was also forced to sleep in the back of the train in the animal car. \\nOne day the other clowns Red-Lighted him, throwing Willie off the moving train. His foot suffered irreparable damage from the fall, and no one wanted to hire a clown with a gimpy leg.\\n\\nThe circus train that Willie had been thrown from crashed and burned to the ground in a horrible fire, killing everyone inside. Miraculously, all of the animals escaped unharmed, the only injury being to a chimp with slightly singed fur.\\n\\nWillie eventually made a living selling dolls in his likeness. Children seemed to love them. My great aunt Lily had one that she kept all her life, and when she died, my mother inherited it. \\nI hated that doll! Its sad eyes seemed to follow me wherever I went. And whenever I did something wrong, I smelled smoke. My mom always seemed to know when I snuck out of bed and went downstairs to watch Headbanger's Ball at midnight. I knew the doll was somehow communicating with my mother to tell her what I was up to. As I grew into my teenage years, my mother had an uncanny ability to tell when I'd been smoking, or with a boy, and, one fine night when I was seventeen, she knew I'd been fall-down drunk behind Color Tile, covered in dry catfood and making out with Big Jay Austin. My mom said the fire alarm went off that night.\\n\\nMy mother gave me the doll as a wedding present. I keep it in my newborn daughter's room. She's too young for Willie to tattle on her now, but in a few years I'll be expecting that first hint of smoke..... #CursedCrate #contest #mysteriouspackageco #haunteddoll #haunted #wearywilly #clown #circus #vintagedoll #emmettkelly #scaryclown #sadclown #inheritance #horrifying #horror #badkid #badgirls\", u'I found this old clock in an abandoned house when I was on a photo shoot.

gifted me this adorable bottle. She found it while shopping in a port bazaar, and the salesman gave it to her for next to nothing. My mother called it a fairy bottle, and knew it was mine the minute she saw it. \\nI've had it for several years, but something has changed. A few weeks ago, I swear a fly was trapped in the window. I could hear the buzzing and tapping on the glass; however, after checking every window in the house, there was no fly. This didn't strike me as odd at first, but after last night, I believe it's all connected. \\nA few days after the fly incident, I heard a faint croaking. It had rained earlier that day, so frogs were out in droves, and I thought one had slipped into the house. Again, I searched. Again, I found nothing. Every few days for the last several weeks, I would hear either a fly or a frog, but I could never find it. I've started dreaming about armies of frogs filling the city, crowding the roads, and even coming out of sink drains. Then, last night happened. \\nI had just started awake from another frog filled dream; I swear it was the frog release scene in E.T. In the darkness, I heard it, the buzzing of flies. I got out of bed and followed the sound. It was like a game of hot or cold: moving around the house to where the buzzing was loudest. I turned the corner from the hallway into the living room.  Sitting on top of the coffee table was the bottle, a sickly, green light glowing from within. Somehow, it had moved from the top of the stereo to its current position. I drew closer, and the glow became brighter. I moved to pull the lid from its resting place. Green light was everywhere. The next thing I remember, I was sitting on the couch, the bottle back in its place on the stereo. \\nI'm hoping someone at your company can tell me what I have in my home, and what could possibly have happened to me when I touched the bottle. If I can understand it, maybe I can live with it.

I'm not even sure which cause it was, the note didn't say and there was no return address on the box. At first I put it in a China cabinet but it kept relocating itself to my bedroom and taking up residence on my antique vanity. Flowers it doesn't like die overnight in it, particularly brightly colored or flashy ones. I put a few stems  of white Bleeding Hearts in it last summer and they lasted for weeks. Even when it's empty there's a faint aroma of flowers around it, lilies mostly, sometimes gardenias. I find myself sitting and staring at it, the scent of flowers long dead lingering in my nose, wondering why it captivates me so, waiting for the night to come and the moonlight to stream in the window, waiting for..... #CursedCrate #MysteriousPackageCo #funeralflowers #vintagevase #losttime #strange #mysterygift #moonlight\", u'This sewing machine, that has been passed down through the family, has a sorted past.

The sad, tattered hobo of the depression era. Willie's dream was to be in the spotlight in a traveling circus, but unfortunately due to his slovenly appearance, he was forced to clean up after the other clowns instead of cultivating his own act. Willie was also forced to sleep in the back of the train in the animal car. \\nOne day the other clowns Red-Lighted him, throwing Willie off the moving train. His foot suffered irreparable damage from the fall, and no one wanted to hire a clown with a gimpy leg.\\n\\nThe circus train that Willie had been thrown from crashed and burned to the ground in a horrible fire, killing everyone inside. Miraculously, all of the animals escaped unharmed, the only injury being to a chimp with slightly singed fur.\\n\\nWillie eventually made a living selling dolls in his likeness. Children seemed to love them. My great aunt Lily had one that she kept all her life, and when she died, my mother inherited it. \\nI hated that doll! Its sad eyes seemed to follow me wherever I went. And whenever I did something wrong, I smelled smoke. My mom always seemed to know when I snuck out of bed and went downstairs to watch Headbanger's Ball at midnight. I knew the doll was somehow communicating with my mother to tell her what I was up to. As I grew into my teenage years, my mother had an uncanny ability to tell when I'd been smoking, or with a boy, and, one fine night when I was seventeen, she knew I'd been fall-down drunk behind Color Tile, covered in dry catfood and making out with Big Jay Austin. My mom said the fire alarm went off that night.\\n\\nMy mother gave me the doll as a wedding present. I keep it in my newborn daughter's room. She's too young for Willie to tattle on her now, but in a few years I'll be expecting that first hint of smoke..... #CursedCrate #contest #mysteriouspackageco #haunteddoll #haunted #wearywilly #clown #circus #vintagedoll #emmettkelly #scaryclown #sadclown #inheritance #horrifying #horror #badkid #badgirls\", u'I found this old clock in an abandoned house when I was on a photo shoot.

She's too young for Willie to tattle on her now, but in a few years I'll be expecting that first hint of smoke..... #CursedCrate #contest #mysteriouspackageco #haunteddoll #haunted #wearywilly #clown #circus #vintagedoll #emmettkelly #scaryclown #sadclown #inheritance #horrifying #horror #badkid #badgirls\", u'I found this old clock in an abandoned house when I was on a photo shoot.  I thought it was neat and brought it home.  It sits on a shelf near my bed. It doesn\\u2019t work, or so I thought\\u2026I have woken up at night to see the children swinging back and forth.  And once, in the middle of the night, I heard what sounded like children running up and down the hall, laughing.  As I laid back down, I swear, there in the dim light\\u2026I could have sworn the swings were empty.  And just a note, I don\\u2019t have any children. #CursedCrate #KidsHauntingMy House #ThereIsAReasonTheClockWasAbandoned. #mysteriouspackageco', u'I do love decorating my #sketchbooks with #stickers I get.

gifted me this adorable bottle. She found it while shopping in a port bazaar, and the salesman gave it to her for next to nothing. My mother called it a fairy bottle, and knew it was mine the minute she saw it. \\nI've had it for several years, but something has changed. A few weeks ago, I swear a fly was trapped in the window. I could hear the buzzing and tapping on the glass; however, after checking every window in the house, there was no fly. This didn't strike me as odd at first, but after last night, I believe it's all connected. \\nA few days after the fly incident, I heard a faint croaking. It had rained earlier that day, so frogs were out in droves, and I thought one had slipped into the house. Again, I searched. Again, I found nothing. Every few days for the last several weeks, I would hear either a fly or a frog, but I could never find it. I've started dreaming about armies of frogs filling the city, crowding the roads, and even coming out of sink drains. Then, last night happened. \\nI had just started awake from another frog filled dream; I swear it was the frog release scene in E.T. In the darkness, I heard it, the buzzing of flies. I got out of bed and followed the sound. It was like a game of hot or cold: moving around the house to where the buzzing was loudest. I turned the corner from the hallway into the living room.  Sitting on top of the coffee table was the bottle, a sickly, green light glowing from within. Somehow, it had moved from the top of the stereo to its current position. I drew closer, and the glow became brighter. I moved to pull the lid from its resting place. Green light was everywhere. The next thing I remember, I was sitting on the couch, the bottle back in its place on the stereo. \\nI'm hoping someone at your company can tell me what I have in my home, and what could possibly have happened to me when I touched the bottle. If I can understand it, maybe I can live with it. Maybe ...\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n#cursedcrate #fairyrealm #stolen #plagueoffrogs #nightmaresaretrue #changling #mysteriouspackageco\", u\"It's just a vase, just a vintage handmade vase. Probably somebody's shop class project or maybe an apprentice's attempt to make something pretty for his mother. I keep telling myself that but questions linger. A charity auction win that I don't remember bidding on, let alone bidding on more then once. Perhaps it was the Sangria or maybe I left the laptop open and the cat wandered across the keyboard. I didn't even remember seeing it in the listings but it arrived with a note thanking me for my generous donation to the cause. I'm not even sure which cause it was, the note didn't say and there was no return address on the box. At first I put it in a China cabinet but it kept relocating itself to my bedroom and taking up residence on my antique vanity. Flowers it doesn't like die overnight in it, particularly brightly colored or flashy ones. I put a few stems  of white Bleeding Hearts in it last summer and they lasted for weeks. Even when it's empty there's a faint aroma of flowers around it, lilies mostly, sometimes gardenias. I find myself sitting and staring at it, the scent of flowers long dead lingering in my nose, wondering why it captivates me so, waiting for the night to come and the moonlight to stream in the window, waiting for..... #CursedCrate #MysteriousPackageCo #funeralflowers #vintagevase #losttime #strange #mysterygift #moonlight\", u'This sewing machine, that has been passed down through the family, has a sorted past.

The sad, tattered hobo of the depression era. Willie's dream was to be in the spotlight in a traveling circus, but unfortunately due to his slovenly appearance, he was forced to clean up after the other clowns instead of cultivating his own act. Willie was also forced to sleep in the back of the train in the animal car. \\nOne day the other clowns Red-Lighted him, throwing Willie off the moving train. His foot suffered irreparable damage from the fall, and no one wanted to hire a clown with a gimpy leg.\\n\\nThe circus train that Willie had been thrown from crashed and burned to the ground in a horrible fire, killing everyone inside. Miraculously, all of the animals escaped unharmed, the only injury being to a chimp with slightly singed fur.\\n\\nWillie eventually made a living selling dolls in his likeness. Children seemed to love them. My great aunt Lily had one that she kept all her life, and when she died, my mother inherited it. \\nI hated that doll! Its sad eyes seemed to follow me wherever I went. And whenever I did something wrong, I smelled smoke. My mom always seemed to know when I snuck out of bed and went downstairs to watch Headbanger's Ball at midnight. I knew the doll was somehow communicating with my mother to tell her what I was up to. As I grew into my teenage years, my mother had an uncanny ability to tell when I'd been smoking, or with a boy, and, one fine night when I was seventeen, she knew I'd been fall-down drunk behind Color Tile, covered in dry catfood and making out with Big Jay Austin. My mom said the fire alarm went off that night.\\n\\nMy mother gave me the doll as a wedding present. I keep it in my newborn daughter's room. She's too young for Willie to tattle on her now, but in a few years I'll be expecting that first hint of smoke..... #CursedCrate #contest #mysteriouspackageco #haunteddoll #haunted #wearywilly #clown #circus #vintagedoll #emmettkelly #scaryclown #sadclown #inheritance #horrifying #horror #badkid #badgirls\", u'I found this old clock in an abandoned house when I was on a photo shoot.

Miraculously, all of the animals escaped unharmed, the only injury being to a chimp with slightly singed fur.\\n\\nWillie eventually made a living selling dolls in his likeness. Children seemed to love them. My great aunt Lily had one that she kept all her life, and when she died, my mother inherited it. \\nI hated that doll! Its sad eyes seemed to follow me wherever I went. And whenever I did something wrong, I smelled smoke. My mom always seemed to know when I snuck out of bed and went downstairs to watch Headbanger's Ball at midnight. I knew the doll was somehow communicating with my mother to tell her what I was up to. As I grew into my teenage years, my mother had an uncanny ability to tell when I'd been smoking, or with a boy, and, one fine night when I was seventeen, she knew I'd been fall-down drunk behind Color Tile, covered in dry catfood and making out with Big Jay Austin. My mom said the fire alarm went off that night.\\n\\nMy mother gave me the doll as a wedding present. I keep it in my newborn daughter's room. She's too young for Willie to tattle on her now, but in a few years I'll be expecting that first hint of smoke..... #CursedCrate #contest #mysteriouspackageco #haunteddoll #haunted #wearywilly #clown #circus #vintagedoll #emmettkelly #scaryclown #sadclown #inheritance #horrifying #horror #badkid #badgirls\", u'I found this old clock in an abandoned house when I was on a photo shoot.  I thought it was neat and brought it home.  It sits on a shelf near my bed. It doesn\\u2019t work, or so I thought\\u2026I have woken up at night to see the children swinging back and forth.  And once, in the middle of the night, I heard what sounded like children running up and down the hall, laughing.  As I laid back down, I swear, there in the dim light\\u2026I could have sworn the swings were empty.  And just a note, I don\\u2019t have any children. #CursedCrate #KidsHauntingMy House #ThereIsAReasonTheClockWasAbandoned. #mysteriouspackageco', u'I do love decorating my #sketchbooks with #stickers I get.

    "**The Mysterious Package Company** uses Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for three distinct different uses in marketing their product through social media. *Facebook* has the largest number of followers (367427). Remarkably, The Mysterious Package Company only has 443 public posts with a stunning 87822 *likes*. This gives them a *like* to *post* ratio of 54%.\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at word frequencies and topic modeling of the posts, it becomes evident that Facebook is almost exclusively used for product release announcements. In fact, there are very few references that indicate themes or storylines of products. Principally, Facebook is used to inform their audience to look at The Mysterious Package Company website for new releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Twitter*, on the other hand, is used almost exclusively for replies to customers. Of the 792 tweets, there are 584 replies to other Twitter users. Following any of the links in the sampled replies leads almost always to some form of customer support. Word frequency bi-grams bears this out. Most of the other types of analysis on The Mysterious Package Company tweets provided little information.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, The Mysterious Package Company's use of *Instagram* is where we find the masterful storytelling that has been the company’s trademark. Although we find only a fraction of the followers that Facebook has (9121 followers), every post is a carefully structured piece of hint fiction. Cryptic images and subtle word usage lure the audience to dig deeper and consider subscribing to another package release. Oddly, the sentiment analysis of followers' comments tended to be neutral with leanings to the positive (very few negative comments...). This may be attributed to fans adopting the indirect language that is the hallmark of hint fiction. Clustering, however, did reveal a number of potential narratives (optimal k-value of 18 clusters). This is particularly intriguing because The Mysterious Package Company reveals very little of their product lineup. Without membership, it is almost impossible to find more than the most recent packages available. If we are to take the clusters literally, it implies that the entire catalog of The Mysterious Package Company may only be 17 to 19 products deep. However, this is purely speculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main outcomes of this of the analysis of The Mysterious Package Company social media footprint is as follows:\n",
    "- Facebook, product announcements to a large customer base\n",
    "- Twitter, customer support for audience members who may be confused by the nature of the product\n",
    "- Instagram, storytelling, and advertising."
