127857990695807_994218007393130,"Is this thing on... hel... hello?? Hi. This is weird... I'm more used to reacting to your comments, so it's different and confusing to be the first one to... 

Hi. It's me, the Messenger. I've been relentlessly ""not answering"" your questions on Facebook for years now. Some of you have confused me for the Curator, which is flattering, but we are very different. For example, if I were the Curator, I'd be writing on parchment right now and asking again why we have to write anything it's just a book full of faces.

Let's get this out of the way quickly: No, we aren't going out of business. No, we haven't been sold to a shady investor who is liquidating the company. Yes, that's exactly what a company doing both those things would say, right? After all, we have been running frequent sales and archiving some of our older Experiences. 

While we won't reveal all our secrets—that has not changed, nor will it ever– we do want to let our biggest supporters know what's happening... which has changed, I'll admit. I'm not used to this ""dispensing real information"" thing. But here goes nothing!

The truth — about the big sales and archiving — is somewhat more mundane. Some of our existing experiences are showing their age, and you, our members, have repeatedly told us that you want more active, involved Experiences. We began 2016 with three Experiences available in our store and were one short of four times that many by the end of 2017. Keeping all the old Experiences is a lot of work and makes it harder to start up new projects.

Hence, we are clearing out our old inventory to make way for the new.

... I have just heard the sound of thousands of ears perking up. For the curious, the sound is off-putting and quite nauseating, though lovely at the same time, like a choir of angelic children struggling to hit a five-part harmony at a school pageant.

Yes, you have heard correctly.  New items are coming later this spring, and they are unlike anything we have ever done before! It has been an adventure keeping our cards so close to our collective chests, all the while staying in the zone to uphold the mystery, but it will be worth it. Perhaps you saw the breadcrumbs we left for one?

In any case, that's all I have for today. Honestly... I'd like to get back to being helpfully unhelpful, now!

Forerunners of Victorian Madness:
Charles Lamb (1775-1834) & Mary Lamb (1764 - 1847)

The Lamb siblings were literary lights of their day. Both were, at different times, considered mad and institutionalized. The Lambs are perhaps best known for their contribution to English letters with Tales from Shakespeare (1807), a prose adaptation of Shakespeare's plays aimed at young readers.

Charles spent six weeks at the madhouse at Hoxton in 1795, a time he describes in a letter to Coleridge as ""spent very agreeably."" Charles continues proudly that he has ""got somewhat rational now, and don't bite anyone."" Just a year later, in September 1796, Mary was briefly confined to Islington after stabbing her and Charles's mother to death in a fit of rage. The mad were not incarcerated for their crimes until what's known as the M'Naghten Rules came into effect (see forthcoming issue of Curios and Conundrums), so Mary was released into her brother's care, and the two lived and worked together until Charles's death from an infection in 1834. Happily for them, Mary's homicidal attack did not seem to impinge on their social life or status and their home became a popular salon for the literati of the day; Coleridge, Shelley, William and his sister Dorothy Wordsworth, were frequent attendees.",For The Literarily Deranged,link,https://www.mysteriouspackage.com/?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=CnC4-1-CML,2017-04-17 07:30:00,253,36,40,212,21,18,2,0,0

Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900)

German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, while in Turin, Italy in 1889  had a severe breakdown from which he never fully recovered. He was quickly taken back to Germany by friends where he was institutionalized and subsequently cared for by his mother and then sister. It has been largely accepted that his dementia was caused by tertiary syphilis; that diagnosis, however, has been challenged in the 21st century. 

Nietzsche's philosophy was always iconoclastic and he was prone to a certain amount of grandiosity — Nietzsche claimed in 1884, well before his breakdown, that his book, Thus Spake Zarathustra, was the ''most significant book of all times and peoples that ever existed.'' The period between 1882 and his breakdown was extremely prolific. In this period he added to new editions of previous works as well as publishing seven books, including some of his most influential: Zarathustra (1883-85), Beyond Good and Evil (1886), and On the Genealogy of Morals (1887).",For The Literarily Deranged,link,https://www.mysteriouspackage.com/?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=CnC4-1-FN,2017-04-15 11:00:00,168,22,39,146,17,5,0,0,0

Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1860-1935)

In 1892 Charlotte Perkins Gilman published ""The Yellow Wallpaper,"" a tale of a woman who goes mad as the result of treatment for nervous depression. The story is a fictionalization of Gilman's real treatment by Silas Weir Mitchell, who advanced the ""rest cure"" treatment for ""hysterical"" women. As the narrator explains, the treatment involves ""phosphates or phosphites which ever it is, and tonics, and journeys, and air, and exercise, and [I] am absolutely forbidden to 'work' until I am well again."" Rather than getting well, the narrator falls deeper and deeper into hallucinogenic delirium, believing there is a woman living in the wallpaper of her room.

As it happens, Silas Weir Mitchell's 21st-century descendant, also named Silas Weir Mitchell, is a television actor. This Mitchell plays a werewolf-like creature called a Wesson who fights supernatural foes with his friend who happens to come from a long line of monster-hunters called Grimms. These people are fictional descendants of Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm, the real-world collectors and editors of Europe's most famous fairy tales.  

We can neither confirm nor deny that the Wessons, the Grimms, or the woman who escaped from Gilman's wallpaper are currently working in the Curios & Conundrum's Victorian London office.",For The Literarily Deranged,link,https://www.mysteriouspackage.com/?utm_source=FB&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=CnC4-1&utm_content=CPG,2017-04-13 11:00:00,193,14,39,162,21,8,2,0,0

APPENDIX A: Facebook Survey *11b7S-aRES
1) Did you feel any discomfort while observing any of these optical illusions? If so, which illusion was the most distressful? 

Was the anguish located behind your eyes, or deep in the centre of your brain? Did it remind you of someone?

2) After a period of effectiveness, did any illusion stop?** Can you specify whether your eyes became more discerning, or were just simply more knowledgeable? 

Did you feel as though you had ascended to another plane of thought? 

What passed through your mind at that moment? Please enter the answer phonetically if the thought was not in any known language.

**Stopping is defined here as ""Ceasing to be an illusion.""

3) Did the sound of a young girl, gleefully singing an old folk song, gradually become audible? Was her voice in the distance, or was it nearby when you first noticed it? 

Did you listen to her voice get closer and closer? 

At what point was she singing directly into your ear? 

Did she remain unseen, like a spirit, or untethered soul?

We have heard unconfirmed reports that the tone of her voice changes once she is singing the song directly to you. Can you confirm whether or not she changes from joyful to seething rage?

What happens next?

127857990695807_744750422339891,"Precisely a year ago today we first examined the story of Santa's forgotten companion, the Yule Goat. Read the original post below. We do have updates for the year 2016, but I'm afraid they aren't of reconciliation or forgiveness. 

If our presumption — that the Yule Goat is still furious at being replaced by reindeer so long ago — is correct, it seems reasonable to presume that it is also the one perpetrating the attacks on the remaining representations of his former ties to the season and its rituals. This year's revenge was swift. The Gävle Goat did not last twenty-four hours before incineration. 

Although the Swedish town of Gävle purports to be tweeting on the Yule Goat's behalf, we note with some perplexity that the following tweet came ""after"" the conflagration:  

""Oh no, such a short amount of time with you my friends. But I shall rise from the ashes and see you next year again!""

127857990695807_600470166767918,"It seems as though each passing day grows shorter, and the measures of time are not as long as we once knew. It may be that the Earth has grown impatient with its orbit and, using our companion Moon as counterbalance, this verdant rock quickens its voyage around the Sun. Have our clocks managed to keep time with the seconds and minutes, calculated over years past to better predict the empty space between stirring, noontide and slumber? Or are the timepieces colluding against us in tandem, hindering our realization that the days are growing ever shorter, mocking the accumulated stress and abbreviated lives of the modern human being.

A theory: as we increasingly relegate numbers and names, abstracts and accomplishments from memory to machinery, is it possible that the intended relief has instead become injury? And what if this injury now fills the void that once stored celebratory dates, the names of your elementary school teachers, family recipes more valued than heirlooms, and the many seemingly unimportant ways in which we felt pure joy. Now, they are replaced by the achievements of industrial science. Through discharge of ostensibly useless information, we may have facilitated an incursion into the chasms left behind. An incursion armed with trepidation, expectancy and disquiet.

Of all living creatures I would argue that flowers that bloom, trees that grow tall, and grasses that we cleave for the comeliness of conformity, are those lives from whom we never fear deposition.  Strangely, we have seen automobiles and abodes overrun by vines and wild blossoms, the smallest roots splitting infrastructure and declaring proprietorship over abandoned buildings and lots. Yet, we do not acknowledge the strength of the seedling.  Those abandoned lots and devastated homes must simply await our fickle interest, when the ownership of overrun space becomes profitable, at which point you can be certain we will assert our dominance. We will take blade to stem. Once again, we are superior...

... save for our memories.

With less concern for the mundane trivialities, we are now able to remember more than we had previously imagined. In addition, the nearly infinite storage capacity of the interconnected world suggests that the incidents we wish forgotten are remembered by keystroke, reminded by octothorpe, and reevaluated by the masses without context. Each fleeting moment - and I appeal to you,  the moments grow shorter day by day - is another to recall each of the memories that you have tried to forget.

And what of the plants? Plants who consume our homes yet purportedly not our lives? They have surpassed us, yet again. Yes, we have groomed their cultivation for millennia. And, it need not even be stated, we are certain that, as our understanding of the world and our universe is of such macrocosmic and microscopic awareness, plants are simply no match for the spirit and ingenuity of the resourceful human being. But we are mistaken. 

The very circumstance, which transforms a strong individual into the projectionist of their very own thousand yard stare, is to a plant but a forgotten memory. To cope with their environment, they have decided not to cope at all, but instead to eliminate the hassle of undesirable retrospection.

Forget and survive. And after all the boastful vainglory and disparagement that we have hurled at our clever and fragrant allies, I sincerely hope they forget and forgive, as well.",Plants have evolved forgetfulness to wipe out memory of stress,link,https://www.newscientist.com/article/2078276-plants-have-evolved-forgetfulness-to-wipe-out-memory-of-stress/,2016-03-03 06:45:00,618,19,98,593,21,4,0,0,0
127857990695807_599991143482487,"Let us lift the veil of our current reality and consider, if but for a fleeting moment, the experience of those who lived long before us. Our ancestors, who relied on the knowledge of their ancestors and those even before them, to be passed down mouth to ear through words and stories, so that they might build shelter, feed the community, heal the sick and improve on that very knowledge to benefit future generations. The early works of a history unwritten allowed elders to answer the questions asked to them by their young. Of noises in the night sky, strange sights in the dark woods, why illness that befalls their siblings, and where their people began existence. 

It is awe-inspiring that the world could be explained at all. If only we could see into the dreams of our past selves. How did one react to the lightning in the sky, or the quaking of the earth? What stories explained the process of growing older, or prepared young women for childbirth? 

And what of the strange abilities belonging to those creatures who walked among them, who's eyes saw clearly in the black of night as though illuminated by daylight, and the legs propelling them at speeds no person could hope to outrun.

Today, through scientific study and careful observation, we feel we know the answers. The rods in their eyes that, when abundant, allow them to see movement more clearly in darkness. Musculature, and the benefit of four legs moving in tight coordination, so they can swiftly chase down prey. These explanations can be comprehended within the world we live in, rather than relying on a supernatural power or unprovable theory.

...however, what we know of our world changes. To go back merely a century and look forward to now, it must appear to be a world of magic, one incomprehensible to the ancestors of old who taught knowledge through story. If we were to look forward to a century from now, is it not certain that our future selves will be as magical to us, just as the present would appear to our great great grandparents?

We can only understand what we see, and we explain the world through what we understand.

We have heard the whistles, cries and harmonies that weave themselves into white noise of the unsuitably named radio silence. But what of sounds heard when out of the range of every radio transmitter on our wired planet? An impossible feat, you might believe. However, our species has been in such a shadow, obstructed from Earth's transmissions. And there was heard an eerie music, sent from the empty void of space.

The explanation has been declared: FM transmitter interference. Perhaps. Or, are we hearing the ancient ballad of a wondrous culture long extinguished from the Universe, the echo of a self-composed dirge? Could it be a coded missive, a cipher in tone, sent from a world of creatures whose self-centered concept of musical language belied a universal familiarity? Much like our assumption that signs and symbols can convey meaning, despite the possibility of an intelligent race of the blind, or telepaths, or who possess a method we could not even begin to fathom.

Or am I turning my gaze to the stars when the truth is beneath my feet, lost in time? Could it be possible that the music was sent from ourselves... to ourselves? 

We've seen the predictions: in the future, where we exist in an endless world of electrical impulses, the human race distilled to a digital representation, language lost to the ages as information degrades by generation. Our descendents will send a cry for help. Knowing we cannot travel forward, they will instead send a warning.

But we do not speak their language, and therefore cannot understand the subtext of fear hidden between the tones. I cannot say for certain what might have been said, however this Space Music inspired an emotion in me, quickly expanding to a concept, until finally taking the form of clear words and meaning. I do not wish to speak for our future selves, though as I interpret the sounds from the dark side of the moon, I cannot censor myself.  In those moaning tones, I hear:

127857990695807_461667723981497,"From the early days of locomotives causing audiences to gasp, through the physical humour and satire of Mr. Chaplin, to the Noir aesthetic of detective and gangster films, and even up to our modern day thrillers, the carefully plotted magic of cinema has charmed people. Who among us has not wished to explore ruins like Indiana Jones, seeking forbidden knowledge? Or to make the connections of a conspiracy that threatens the security of our planet, like James Bond? Perhaps the excitement of discovering, with absolute certainty, that we are not alone in the universe, like Eleanor Arroway, is the scene you wish to be a part of.

In film, these are well lit, intricately laid out moments, designed by artists to elicit a feeling of magic in the viewer. What makes them so effective is these moments do happen in our real lives as well. Who does not have a fond memory of a sun-soaked summer in their youth? Or the moment you kissed your first love? These memories are presented to us in our mind's eye as shiny, as well lit, and with a musical score that makes our hearts soar.

These cinematic moments are what we at The Mysterious Package Company strive to create for your kith and your kin, and, of course, for you. We carefully craft our experiences to be remembered with the lighting just so, with the wide-eyed excitement of a silver screen protaganist. The stories we tell are layered, with crates that are difficult to open, and they reward research. As a result, they create lasting memories, the sort that lead to telling and retelling, stories that will be shared forever.

127857990695807_452480908233512,"My dearest friends,

For your consideration, I present to you the case materials of the incident known only as The Weeping Book. It concerns the story of an uncommonly happy boy, one who made the transition into adolescence with more ease than most. He worked with student government, had a part-time job, and was well liked by his teachers, his employer, and his myriad friends, which made the events that occurred all the more unexpected and horrifying.

Those who knew him best consistently used the same word to describe his transition: haunted. Something happened to this boy, something terrible, something that has happened to those on the verge of adulthood for decades and centuries before. You see, this story is not his alone. Inside is another, screaming to get out.

The Weeping Book is our first curated, single-mailing experience. As with all our offerings, it is available exclusively to our members. I encourage you to apply now, for free, to view this, and the other experiences we offer.

Your servant,

Locked in an ideological battle that went beyond rationality, each side prepared for a worst-case scenario, and research into extreme methods of recuperative therapy were theorized. Rumours abound of gruesome experiments, destroyed with the fall of the Iron Curtain, with only the ash of burned documents and bodies left in their wake.

What we propose is that it is more than mere hypothesis, that these experiments were not only pursued, but successfully completed. We propose that decades of research and hundreds of subjects were sacrificed in this quest, and we propose that neither all the documentation, nor all the other materials, were destroyed. We propose there is evidence, evidence that we are willing to share, to show there is more than just speculation in the stories of Risen.

When we say that we tell stories you can touch, this refers to more than simply the physical items that you hold in your hand. Our stories are steeped in real history, with narratives that reward research into the items we send. For the curious, they provide a rich web of supporting material that we do not include, blurring the line between reality and fiction in a unique and entertaining way via post.

We have all had cinematic moments in our lives, those all too infrequent times of unusual serendipity, where the light is right, and things happen in ways that solidify in your memory and seem to shine brighter upon recollection. Creating those moments is what we at The Mysterious Package Company do.

It may begin with an unexpected vintage postcard from someone with a familiar last name, obliquely referring to a curse. A week or two later, some diary pages arrive, accompanied by a newspaper article about the sender of the postcard. Several days later, a parcel arrives, containing a wooden crate that has been nailed shut, one that requires the use of tools to open. Within, nestled among old straw and additional newspaper articles, a statue wrapped in old cloth is unveiled.

By telling a story over time, delivered by post, we create a cinematic moment for the recipient, a narrative they will tell people as it is happening, and will then repeat it for years to come. The artifact is not the gift; it is merely a touchstone of the experience, something that others may ask about, sparking a retelling of the story, a story that began with an unexpected vintage postcard from someone with a familiar last name.

We are a members-only organization, in order to prevent those receiving our experiences from being able to find out the details of what they are to obtain. Membership is free, but you must apply on our site to be considered. I do hope to see you join our little adventure.

Rather than simply giving a ""thing"" as a gift this season, consider bringing your loved ones into a mystery, and putting them at the centre of an experience they'll never forget.

It begins with a letter or postcard, and ends with a handmade wooden crate that has been nailed shut. What is contained within the crate? Adventure, suspense, whimsy, and mystery... and the touchstone of a journey that took place in their living room.

This year, give the gift of a lasting memory, and a story that will be told and retold, to kith and to kin, for generations.

So, what is in the crate? Adventure. Suspense. Whimsy. Mystery. Membership is only the first step; I look forward to showing you more.

The world was widely divided between countries who were bound by, or protected by, NATO, and those that were grouped by the Warsaw Pact. The spread of communism was seen as a great evil by one side, and the corporate greed and inequality of capitalism as a great evil on the other.

There was, indeed, a Great Evil, but it was neither economic philosophy that held that grandiose title. Inspired by mutual fear and hatred, scientists on both sides of this divide worked diligently to give their superpower the upper hand. While we mere mortals were most obviously in fear of nuclear annihilation, one team developed something so awful, so terrifying, something that could leave a deep psychic scar on the population of the entire earth.

These six will be chosen from amongst those who have had their membership approved, by lottery. 

Who will these lucky six be? Be sure to watch your emails on the 1st of February to see if you have been chosen! If you have not, do not fret, you will assuredly be chosen soon. Should one of the six decline to purchase a package at this time, although for the life of me I cannot understand why they would, a replacement account will be chosen at that time, so stay tuned to your emails. As with all things in life, you never know when something unexpected is going to turn up on your doorstep.

Your servant,

The Curator

The Mysterious Package Company is formally launching on February 1st. Upon our launch, we will no longer be immediately approving memberships. If you are interested in sending a mysterious package to someone you love ever in the future, now is the time to act. Apply now to ensure your acceptance.

http://apply.mysteriouspackage.com

Membership provides the exclusive ability to send packages, and once we close membership the only reliable way to become a member is through an existing member. Additionally, members receive information from our Curator, who is currently in Peru diligently seeking out artifacts and the stories they tell.

Initial purchases will be limited to six people selected at random from our launch membership. We'll be contacting those six people on February 1st as well. Shortly thereafter, we will be allowing any member to purchase a package, though quantities will be limited.

It would be a terrible shame if you were disappointed, so please apply now and secure your opportunity to give someone a gift they will remember forever.

** What does membership get me? **

Purchase Packages.
Only members can purchase packages from us. In addition, all of the package information is hidden in a members-only section of our site, which keeps your recipient from being able to find out details of your gift and ruining your surprise. Only members will know what is behind the curtain.

Information from the Curator.
He's a pretty interesting guy, and he's eager to tell you about his experiences. Members get exclusive information and emails sent by the Curator himself, including puzzles and contests that may net you a little something special.

Preorder Lottery Access.
We'll be launching a little early for a few lucky members. The first six packages will be offered as right-of-first-refusal randomly to six lucky members. If you're excited to send someone an experience they'll never forget, make sure to apply right away!

http://apply.mysteriouspackage.com

What? Who said anything about a secret society? Certainly not us, and there definitely won't be any information about any such thing made available to members. It's best if you forget that we even mentioned it, which we didn't.
