In the story (whether or not you experienced it or something like it, or was shielded., on the surface something gives us the impression that the main character's significant other is cheating. Bits and pieces of evidence keep piling up that they're a creep and it culminates in the GOTCHA moment...

... generally, it is around this point, when the main characters best friend says that they know where the cheating partner will be meeting their new love tonight, too! So, the main character goes to the scene of the crime, and kicks in the door... and we are treated to an embarrassing display where the significant other is caught caring for a sick grandmother, or sibling, or puppy. And when this fact is slid in to place as the answer for all the behaviour... it all makes so much more sense than the dramatic ""obviously they've gone evil and want to destroy everything good"" theory of good writing.

CaC was left to wither and die on the vine with Vol. 4. The Vault then disappeared, making the Omnibus sale of CaC rather pointless for those who wished to tackle the Vault after buying all three Volumes. The GDA has yet to be mentioned or promoted on the main site as a potential replacement. Tomb, Filigree, and Cult are now being discounted in addition to the 20% sale option sitewide. Common wisdom as well as past experience shows us what is likely to happen to those particular experiences next. 

King in Yellow and Demon Jar are archive-bound, while Risen!, Ceiba Tree/Werejaguar, and Century Beast have been discontinued/archived. By my math, that leaves Tempus, Weeping Book, John Augur, Cult, Tomb, and Filigree. 

The general consensus is that of dismay and disappointment amongst your diehard CaC and Experience fans on the Unofficial Forum. While your sales have spurred some frenzied impulse buying, some of the longest-known and active members are actively boycotting any further purchases. 

Communication and customer service has also fallen by the wayside. When there was once excellent communication and response times to inquiries, we now have multiple accounts of unanswered emails or long-delayed actions to fulfill orders. 

So, please allow me some well-deserved skepticism when your assurances of further life are betrayed by your past and current actions. 

It's what the MPC is doing, not what it is saying that breaks my heart. I have previously extolled the virtues of your company to my like-minded friends, and you have profited from their subsequent patronage. But now, I cannot in good conscience recommend your products, or your company, to anyone else for fear of a lackluster and unfulfilling experience. 

To be clear, I do hope you can turn this ship around...especially before you find there is no one left to follow you on your journey.",2018-03-21 00:39:04,4

Please know that I would never do such a tasteless joke unless I thought I might be the FIRST TO EVER DO IT! I figured my other choices were obvious, therefore likely first used in elementary school, and therefore might still carry a sting. Besides... AJ seems to be having a rough go of it today.

While I commend you on all the nifty goodies that were sent in the mailings, the depth of the mystery was quite flat.

From the start, the letter from "" the lawyers"" firm was easily debunked. It would have been much more interesting had something could have been found about the firm on line. For instance, the winning of a mythical case, the naming of a councilor from the firm to the bar. Something that when searched would have seemed to give credibility to the firm rather than no results. Instantly, the momentum was lost.

An archive of historical documents could be posted that would lead people to snippets or fragments pertaining to different segments of the mystery. A lost letter from Aunt Edna Mae or newspaper clipping with a tagline that would be caught up in a search. *( mummy visits London owned by Mr. Smith for instance.)

The second mailing produced hieroglyphics that were already deciphered in the enclosed letter - no fun there, wheres the challenge?  Basically, the mystery is a great read but dont expect the opportunity to tune your inner Sherlock Holmes.

And a final thought. Many people share their Credit Cards with the person they want to buy for. Talk about an instant spoiler. Add paypal as an opportunity for a little cloaking for the person buying the package.

All in all, this was my first and most likely only purchase. Id have to rate it as highly disappointing and expensive for the limited mystery solving.",2018-02-16 16:06:09,0

Oh deary me, if we could harvest data instead of developing and producing products, enduring a complex shipping process involving multiple mailings in order to fulfill orders... we would GLADLY harvest data! Making money by doing nothing sounds nice.

In my experience as an online person (albeit, one who rarely answers the question that is asked and often answers the one that isn't, which you are experiencing right now) a tell-tale sign that someone is collecting your information to sell is that they need multiple data points that are exclusive to you: an email with your first and last name, along with your address with a zip/postal code. Now THAT would be valuable. 

Think of every time someone asked for your financial information for a free trial, and then two weeks later a random survey popped up that asked you for your household income, all to sign up for your ""free trial."" 

They win! They have a whole profile, an idea of how much money you make (and how much might be laying around), where you live, what stores are nearby...

If you investigate our application form, we ask you for  three things: a name to call you, an email to reach you, and whether or not you can keep a secret.

Unless ""How well can you keep a secret?"" has become the clever portal to someone's bank account, you can see that you aren't giving your information for advertising... 

... oh, except to us, I suppose. That would be the point of asking for your email, wouldn't it. To get in touch and let you know what's going on.

I know I will never make all Gibson's laugh... it is impossible! Gibson's can tell when someone is purposefully trying to make a Gibson laugh! Their laughter ceases. CEASES! Their faces become stern. STERN!

As for the Cunninghams. I often imagine the skill of ""hilarity"" as though it was a long-distance race. 

I sprint full force, the last of my spirit and soul fuelling my legs at a relentless rhythm, propelling my feet to hit the pavement at such a frequency that you swear it creates an audible ""hummmmm"" hovering at a bass pitch just at the edge of your hearing. We have left all the other contenders in the dust – dust the friction of my feet has left three degrees warmer to all those in my wake. 

I would count myself the ""luckiest"" person ever to walk the Earth if I could see a shape, just passing beneath the curve of the earth, far on the horizon.

After my fruitless review of the article, I felt a visit to my favorite coffee house and my 3pm therapy appointment would prove beneficial.  My feeling was incorrect at best. I am still processing this life event:

In preparation for my mental explosion, I washed my hair and gathered a small collection of wooden spoons to clench in my jaw for the moment of intense mind boggling so as to relieve the pressure and prevent actual explosion. After ensuring my last will and testament was properly worded, I proceeded to open the link. 

Through my burning eyes (due to intense perspiration), I witnessed a spinning dancer.  The dancer maintained direction in her spin and I began to weep. A person becomes lonely after a certain age and I had found myself comforted in the idea that a humanoid female may join me 
in song. 
She never manifested and my optics were not illusioned. 
Again and again, I begged my brain to allow me some sort of explosion. A sparkler. A mental firefly. 

I regret inform you that nothing...NOTHING happened. I sat alone in silence, disenchanted. The plate of cookies for my folk singing visitor lay untouched.

I now have a $700 psychiatry bill, stale cookies, a broken heart and caffeine jitters.  My brain has failed me.",2017-05-12 09:30:29,1

I am about to deliver them to my son at boarding school this weekend where he is forming in an old Victorian mansion with 8 other boys.  Somehow I felt your unique services would fit into the mood of the place.  They also get the internet turned off at 9 each night so have nothing to do. It's this or the local bowling alley/karaoke place. 

My dilemma is I now, after peeking in one of the envelopes, (which were difficult to neatly pry open) do not want to forward said package.  He has called me a heartless gutter snipe in the past and I am terrified I will fulfill this prophecy.

Is this the Conundrum that was promised?  It is indeed horrible.  Why did I ever open that box up?",2017-02-03 09:23:33,0

I've been a member of both the Mysterious Package Company and the Mystery Experiences Company. The latter was... disappointing, for much of the same reasons you mentioned. What little puzzles present were almost infantile in difficulty, and the ""box of themed crap"" was of poor quality. I'd say more, but you seem to be familiar with them, and frankly there isn't much more to say than you already said.

Mysterious Package Company is very different. There are two main pieces... the experiences, and the quarterly newsletter.

The experiences are very in-depth stories that develop over the course of months, keeping the participant in suspense whilst awaiting the next shipment. I wouldn't say these experiences are puzzle-heavy... while there is certainly some puzzlement, but I feel the primary focus is on the story. And the Curator and his coterie do weave a fantastic story! Various pieces of the story may lead you to websites that expand the story, or to real-life research that helps immerse you in the story. The coup-de-grace is the ""artifact"" that comes with each story. Those will blow you away. I've purchased every single experience MPC has offered, including both Kickstarters and two bespoke experiences specially created just for me, and I've not once been disappointed.

But perhaps the real gem, if you are a puzzle seeker, is the quarterly newsletter. It's full of fun stories and puzzles that blur the line between fact and fiction. Each year there's a new ""episode"", and it stretches throughout the entire year. The puzzles here are often very difficult and take the entire community to solve (both an internal ""Sitting Room"" forum and a wiki site), but there are plenty of smaller puzzles to keep one interested. Each newsletter also comes with various trinkets and minor artifacts--some of which may be clues to the greater story. Or just be part of the fun.

Overall, MPC maybe a bit more expensive than MEC, but I can't stress how much better it is. It's an investment in money and also in time. But if you have the desire and wherewithal to delve into these stories, I promise you will not be underwhelmed.",2016-12-08 13:45:21,2

I am definitely a lover of puzzles, and things that will challenge me mentally. Otherwise, I'm bored. So you can imagine my disappointment with the MEC, especially after having paid $150 for a ""premium"" experience. I made a sort of ""escape room/puzzle/mystery"" thing at home for my boyfriend, the end being the location of a rad gift and he was more entertained by what I made in a couple days than with what was sent to us by MEC. I should have known, though, just from the witty replies of MPC that they would be far more clever. They accepted me, so perhaps it's time to make a purchase!  (P.S. Aren't they lucky?! MPC, I mean. They get to use their brains and creativity to entertain and challenge us all. So fun. I'm jealous.)",2016-12-08 13:53:39,2

I made one for my gf that she had to solve before getting her birthday gifts this year ;) And I agree that they're lucky... if they were local to me, I'd do whatever's in my power to bribe, coerce, or blackmail them to letting me join their team!

Since puzzles seem to be your main interest, I'd definitely recommend the newsletter membership. The experiences are phenomenal, but they seem to be more about an immersive, even tactile, story than a full-on brainteaser. 

That said... you should definitely treat yourself to on experience, too. Their new Demon Jar is, I believe, based on a bespoke experience I had them make for my gf a few years ago.

I was worried you had been taken over. Now that it's not as exclusive, I may have to bust out my handbook and memorize some things. I'm not even sure you are who you say you are which technically  can't be because you never said who you were before nor did you just say now.... how conveniently of ""you"". I'm thinking there may be a lot of spies around now. MPC or even you may have been compromised. I mean... people are not even asked their blood type anymore. I have my eye on you. Old MPC has been preparing me for this. 

My husband was accepted in an instant. I don't trust him now. He could also be a spy. Maybe he just married me to find out what I know about an inner circle? He sure did take a fancy to my last member's kit stash. I have my eye on both of you. All of you. 

You can't win my trust over that easy. 

I guess I should change my name on the ""MPC website"" that has conviently changed also. So the others don't think I'm a double agent. [[PHOTO]]",2017-09-21 07:29:15,0

I thank you ever so much for your constant and most meticulous work at the Mysterious Package Company. I feel quite fortunate in having discovered both you and your company, and have lavished both myself and two of my closest compatriots with some of your most delectable offerings. My experience with Tempus Fugit shall not be soon forgotten, and I dare say that the Weeping Book left quite the haunting impression on my cousin Aaron. I bequeathed an experience of the King in Yellow upon my friend Charles, and though his last letter expressed excitement at the prospect of such a mystery to solve, nobody has heard from him since. I fear the worst. I fear the madness of the King has overtaken him. We are currently investigating his disappearance, and any information that you may have on the matter would be greatly appreciated. 
While I also appreciate your persistence in the matter of soliciting monies for the purchase of your exciting new membership kits, I think that you shall find, in your records, that I am both currently a member, and am anxiously awaiting the arrival of my own membership kit, purchased this past July. I believe that my wife may indeed forgive me one membership kit, but I may find myself in a most depressingly divorced state, should I dip my hand into our collective purses for another.

Again, your exemplary efforts are to be commended, and I would have you know that I hold your company in the highest regard. Thank you for all that you do.

Faithfully yours,

Blaine Cully

To whom it may concern, Namely The Mysterious Package Company
I wish to lodge a complaint of a most serious nature against one Athena Kelly. It pains me to have to do this, but I have spoken to her privately on the matter more than once and she refuses to amend her behavior. Such carryings on are disreputable and not to be tolerated in polite society. 
I am afraid, dear Mysterious Package Company, that Mrs. Kelly, a woman of supposedly mature years, and station in life has given herself over to the debauchery of having fun. 
This is clearly a matter of some urgency which requires action be taken immediately to rectify the situation. 
I await your prompt and decisive responce. 

Yours Sincerely.

If you can afford to, I would highly recommend the beginning....and pay for the Catch Up Omnibus. If I had just started with the latest it would not have meant a whole lot to me. You don't get the curios but the Wiki and the AMAZING C&C forum have pictures of the curios so you get a sense of what arrived. It's a really great place to get your feet wet. You might need nudges and hints but the folks are really great and will help you. You could also just go to the forum and jump in there.  www.curiosandconundrums.freeforums.net.

They have developed stories and plots that you become immersed with and can debate decisions and they teach you things like overcoming all obstacles and fighting for what you believe and and what's right.

There's a pretty intense mission about halfway through where you have to actively torture someone, including water boarding. 

One of my favorite games of all time actually, but agreed with Craig Williams (even if that isn't the specific game) that that is in fact a bit much for a 13 year old. I admit that to this day that the GTA:V torture sequence is the only video game mission that really made me squirm and feel incredibly uncomfortable and even upset, and I've played a *lot* of games in my day and have what I think is a pretty damn strong constitution.

Using GTA as an example, if I looked back on my childhood for example, I wouldn't have let myself play GTA at 13, I would've waited until I was about 15/16. But every kid is different, and sits at different maturity levels at different ages. 

That being said, I've been a big gamer my entire life (and still am), and my parents were entirely ok and supportive of it. But like Craig above, they also were still intent on encouraging a plethora of other interests and activities, because just in general, kids should be encouraged to pursue a wide variety of interests and hobbies. There's an enormous amount of fun to be found in infinite different places, and kids should be exploring every nook and cranny possible.",2016-03-30 10:34:00,3

You could call is spiritual fear 
It's that fear you feel when you wake up and you didn't know you were asleep and now the worlds responsibilities come down on you 
It has many other disguise's however 
It can be deep fear that you acquired from something you don't even remember like being raped at a very early age 
This type of fear never leaves you 
You have to learn it and learn in straight up 
Even then you can't Get rid of it 
You can learn to live with it and it will go away in a long long time 
If you have bad fear you need professional help 
Also maybe some mucshrooms or most of the normal psychedelics will bring the root of the cause of the fear to the surface",2016-03-30 15:32:41,0

If both of those cursed went down one tunnel, only one group's members would contradict each other. If they went in separate groups, 2 groups' members would contradict each other.

Assuming nobody else lies, it should be easy to tell which group the liars are in since either one or 2 groups' members would contradict each other.

After that, it should be easy to tell who the liars are. If both are in one group, the 2 that agree are the liars. If in separate groups, for each group, the liar is the member who contradicts the other two.

Once you know who's telling the truth, you can tell whether each of the 3 tunnels is the exit or not. If none of them are, the tunnel that nobody explored is the exit. Simple.

Of course, that assumes everyone's able to talk really fast or else like 10 minutes will be spent trying to get the results.

Instruct all to leave the cave if they find the exit and return if they do not. When the occupants of three of the tunnels return to the center the middle person points to the exit and they all escape because if he is lying the others know if they had just come from that tunnel.

However, we strongly recommend both investigating the spoiler envelope at the bottom of the experience to ensure the content is appropriate, and ensure the parents are included in some way (even if it's just warning them beforehand), so they can actively observe.

None of our experiences include sexual content of any kind, and at most have a touch of strong language, and might be rated PG-13 if they were movies. However, there are often elements of horror that might be troublesome for certain children, which is why we recommend reviewing the content prior to sending.

The Joulupukki or ""Yule Buck"" is originally a pagan tradition. He is connected to Wōden of norse mythology and said to wear red leather pants and a fur trimmed red leather coat.[citation needed] On the Winter Solstice, going by the names of Jólnir (yule figure) and Langbarðr (long-beard), Wōden led the Wild Huntaccompanied by Thor driving his flying wagon drawn by goat bucks. The Joulupukki may also be a man turned into a goat-man on Christmas Eve, as seen in Elsa Beskow's Peter and Lotta's Christmas. There persists today in some parts of Finland the custom of persons dressing in goat costume to perform in return for leftover food after Christmas. Historically, such a person was an older man, and the tradition refers to him as anuuttipukki.[citation needed]

Today, Joulupukki looks and behaves mostly like hisAmerican cousin, but there are differences. Joulupukki's house and workshop are situated in the mountains of Korvatunturi, whereas his American counterpart resides somewhere near the North Pole. Another difference is that instead of sneaking in through thechimney during the late hours, Joulupukki knocks on the front door during Christmas Evecelebrations. Upon entering, he traditionally greets the household with ""Onko täällä kilttejä lapsia?"" (""Are there [any] well-behaved children here?"").

He usually wears warm red robes (but with a broad band of blue near the fur), uses a walking stick, and travels in asleigh pulled by a number ofreindeer, which cannot fly like Santa Claus's fleet. In Lapland, his mount is a pulkka rather than a sleigh. The popular holiday song ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"", in its Finnish translation, Petteri Punakuono, has led to Rudolph's general acceptance in Finland as Joulupukki's lead reindeer. Joulupukki is often mentioned as having a wife, Joulumuori (""Old Lady Christmas""), but tradition says little of her.",2015-12-24 00:27:22,26

It's a story told as a series of strange and mysterious packages, letters, etc. Pledging at the appropriate level sends these artifacts (letters, clippings, and of course, possibly the crate) that tell the story to you or someone you choose. Different levels determine, I don't want to say ""how much of the story"" because that sounds like you only get a beginning and no resolution if you go for the bronze experience, but you get more... depth? to the story. You get a much more full experience, a novel vs a short story in terms of how deep the story goes.
